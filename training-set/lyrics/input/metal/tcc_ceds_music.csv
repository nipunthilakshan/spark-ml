No one saw me, no one has realized that I've escaped., The coldness from the hard stonewalls doesn't bother me. The difficult, decision that lies before me weigh heavily upon my shoulders., A possibility of a fate far worse? Darkness and anxiety increase, and sharpen my senses. The evening dew makes the air do damp, and cold, allowing my breath to create tiny, white veils that surround, me - or is it something else? Sense a presence that doesn't, scare. My heart's not pounding anymore, calmness rinses through, my body and I clasp my hands, collecting myself in hopes for an answer., , I cry out to you, like I've done many times before, I hope you listen to my prayer tonight, I'm in desperate need of help.
